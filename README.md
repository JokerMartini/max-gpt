OpenAI's ChatGPT integration with 3ds Max

# Overview
This is simply a proof-of-concept for integrating ChatGPT AI into 3ds Max.
This is a proof-of-concept integration of ChatGPT into Unity Editor. 

# How do I install it?


# How to try it
You have to generate an API key to use the ChatGPT API. Please generate it on your account page and then copy/paste the api key into this tools Settings dialog.

You can open the AI Command window from Window > AI Command.

# System requirements

# Frequently asked questions
Is this tool reliable?

Definitely not! The code generated by ChatGPT is not always going to reliably create successful code. But it's fun to give it a shot. If it fails, simply click the execute button again and OpenAI will generate another set of code and in some cases it's successful.

# Can i use this in commercial work.
Use it however you want.
